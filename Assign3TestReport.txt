For the myar program extensive tests were run.  It was a complex program so this is understandable.
In the makefile I wrote and ran automated tests for the q, t, v, d, and x features.  These are
all the features that run identically to their ar counterparts.  For the -A and -w features, I 
still ran many unit tests but they simply were not automated.  The automated tests would run
the myar and ar programs with the same commands and then ensure that all the measurable outputs
were the same.  For the -A and -w tests, I tested in a similar manner, except I compared to what
was expected if using ar was not possible, and in some cases I would use ar in the same manner that
-A was designed to be used in and then diff the outcomes.  -w was mostly tested using expected 
outcomes and then by looking at the array using cat as it shares less functionality with ar. I ran
tests with both the given 'number' text documents, and with many other of my own created test docs
as well.

For the sig_demo program, only basic testing was needed as this was a simple program.  The program
was run multiple times without issue and always reporting the correct output.
